Heya, Zephyr here

So yeah, alatas is official - i will try to keep it updated, but im still a human being so dont expect me to be up to date all time

Oh and AME detects it as Malicious, thats why there is folder with all Alatas stuff.
i simply changed wallpapers, file names and slightly changed code - it was matter of changing from "enable bluetooth" to something else, so that might be why AME thinks its Malicious

this peace of shit wouldnt be possible without help from Vytrol on discord. thanks again bro!

Got some feedback? dm me on discord, or send your ideas and other stuff to alatas.zephyr@gmail.com

The fuck am i doing now? Soon i will start working on AtlasOs RC2 based alatas. you can expect it... one day
